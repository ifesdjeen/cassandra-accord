/**
 * REMEMBER AT ALL TIMES WHEN MODIFYING.
 * This class does THREE things:
 *  - Calculates execution dependencies. For this we must witness all transactions that may execute before
 *    (at least via some transitive relation). We cannot remove transactions we have executed locally unless
 *    they are represented by some other transaction we return (such as an exclusive sync point or a later
 *    transaction that has it durably as a dependency).
 *    This includes transactions we have imported from earlier epochs, either directly or transitively
 *    via the dependencies of other transactions we know of.
 *  - Computes recovery decisions.
 *      - This missing collection is involved here, to decide if the transaction we are recovering
 *        has been witnessed and therefore may have taken the fast path.
 *      - This must include any transactions from future epochs, for which we must maintain accurate deps
 *        (but do not execute, and should never set to APPLIED)
 *  - Ensures transactions execute locally in the correct order.
 *      - The missing collection is involved in this, but can ignore any transactions that are pre-bootstrap,
 *        or execute outside of our epoch ownership information.
 *
 *  Each of these features has different constraints and requirements. Because a change satisfies one or two of the three
 *  does not mean it is safe!
 *
 * <h2>Introduction</h2>
 * A specialised collection for efficiently representing and querying everything we need for making coordination
 * and recovery decisions about a key's command conflicts, and for managing execution order.
 *
 * Every command we know about that is not shard-redundant is listed in the {@code byId} collection, which is sorted by {@code TxnId}.
 * This includes all transitive dependencies we have witnessed via other transactions, but not witnessed directly.
 *
 * <h2>Contents</h2>
 * This collection tracks kinds of transactions differently:
 * - Range transactions are tracked ONLY as dependencies; if no managed key transactions witness a range transaction
 *   it will not be tracked here. The dependencies of range transactions are not themselves tracked at all.
 *   A range transaction that depends on some key for execution will be registered as an unmanaged transaction
 *   to track when it may be executed.
 * - Key (Exclusive)?SyncPoints are tracked fully until execution; we fully encode their dependencies, and track their lifecycle.
 *   This permits them to be consulted for recovery. Once they are stable, they will be registered as unmanaged transactions for execution.
 * - Key Reads and Writes are first class citizens. We fully encode their dependencies, track their lifecycle and also
 *   directly manage their execution.
 *
 * <h2>Dependency Encoding</h2>
 * The byId list implies the contents of the deps of all commands in the collection - that is, it is assumed that in
 * the normal course of events every transaction will include the full set of {@code TxnId} we know that could be
 * witnessed by the command. We only encode divergences from this, stored in each command's {@code missing} collection.
 *
 * We then go one step further, exploiting the fact that the missing collection exists solely to implement recovery,
 * and so we elide from this missing collection any {@code TxnId} we have recorded as {@code Committed} or higher.
 * Any recovery coordinator that contacts this replica will report that the command has been agreed to execute,
 * and so will not need to decipher any fast-path decisions. So the missing collection is redundant, as no command's deps
 * will need to be queried for this TxnId's presence/absence.
 * TODO (expected) this logic applies equally well to Accepted
 *
 * The goal with these behaviours is that this missing collection will ordinarily be empty, occupying no space.
 *
 * <h2>Garbage Collection</h2>
 * This collection is trimmed by two mechanisms: pruning applied transactions and removing redundant transactions.
 *
 * 1) redundantBefore represents the local lower bound covering the key for transactions having all been applied or
 * invalidated. This is not the global lower bound, but we know that anything with a lower TxnId is either committed
 * locally and we will report this decision to any distributed recovery OR it will not execute and so we may safely
 * report that it is unknown to us in this collection. So we may simply erase these.
 *
 * 2) prunedBefore represents a local bound that permits us to optimistically remove data from the CommandsForKey
 * that may need to be loaded again later. Specifically, we pick an applied {@code TxnId} that we will retain, and we
 * remove from the {@code CommandsForKey} any transaction with a lower {@code TxnId} and {@code executeAt} that is also
 * applied or invalidated.
 *
 * [We only do this if there also exists some later transactions we are not pruning that collectively have a superset of
 * its {@code missing} collection, so that recovery decisions will be unaffected by the removal of the transaction.]
 *
 * The complexity here is that, by virtue of being a local decision point, we cannot guarantee that no coordinator will
 * contact us in future with either a new TxnId that is lower than this, or a dependency collection containing a TxnId
 * we have already processed.
 *
 * [We pick a TxnId stale by some time bound so that we can expect that any earlier already-applied TxnId will
 * not be included in a future set of dependencies - we expect that "transitive dependency elision" will ordinarily filter
 * it; but it might not on all replicas.]
 *
 * The difficulty is that we cannot immediately distinguish these two cases, and so on encountering a TxnId that is
 * less than our {@code prunedBefore} we must load the local command state for the TxnId. If we have not witnessed the
 * TxnId then we know it is a new transitive dependency. If we have witnessed it, and it is applied, then we load it
 * into the {@code CommandsForKey} until we next prune to avoid reloading it repeatedly. This is managed with the
 * {@link #loadingPruned} btree collection.
 *
 * <h2>Transitive Dependency Elision</h2>
 * {@code CommandsForKey} also implements transitive dependency elision.
 * When evaluating {@code mapReduceActive}, we first establish the last-executing Stable write command (i.e. those whose deps
 * are considered durably decided, and so must wait for all commands {@code Committed} with a lower {@code executeAt}).
 * We then elide any {@code Committed} command that has a lower executeAt than this command that would be witnessed by that command.
 *
 * Both commands must be known at a majority, but neither might be {@code Committed} at any other replica.
 * Either command may therefore be recovered.
 * If the later command is recovered, this replica will report its Stable deps, thereby recovering them.
 * If this replica is not contacted, some other replica must participate that either has taken the same action as this replica,
 * or else does not know the later command is Stable, and so will report the earlier command as a dependency again.
 * If the earlier command is recovered, this replica will report that it is {@code Committed}, and so will not consult
 * this replica's collection to decipher any fast path decision. Any other replica must either do the same, or else
 * will correctly record this transaction as present in any relevant deps of later transactions.
 *
 * TODO (required): tighten semantics around transactions that are not owned by this CFK, which occur in two to three cases:
 *      1) when a dependency calculation must report dependencies imported from a prior epoch.
 *         in this case we do not need to manage dependencies for the transaction, only report the transaction itself.
 *      2) when a transaction proposed in a future epoch visits an earlier epoch, it is registered here for recovery
 *         decisions, so that recovery does not need to contact future epochs to find any superseding transactions
 *      3) when an accept round visits a later epoch than the one in which it is agreed.
 * TODO (desired):  track whether a TxnId is a write on this key only for execution (rather than globally)
 * TODO (expected): merge with TimestampsForKey
 * TODO (desired):  save space by encoding InternalStatus in TxnId.flags(), so that when executeAt==txnId we can save 8 bytes per entry
 * TODO (expected): remove a command that is committed to not intersect with the key for this store (i.e. if accepted in a later epoch than committed on, so ownership changes)
 * TODO (expected): avoid updating transactions we don't manage the execution of - perhaps have a dedicated InternalStatus
 * TODO (expected): minimise repeated notification, either by logic or marking a command as notified once ready-to-execute
 * TODO (required): better linearizability violation detection
 * TODO (expected): cleanup unmanaged transitively known transactions
 * TODO (desired): introduce a new status or other fast and simple mechanism for filtering treatment of range or unmanaged transactions
 * TODO (desired): store missing transactions against the highest known transaction only (this should also permit us to prune better by ignoring the missing collection contents)
