     * PreCommitted is a peculiar state, half-way between Accepted and Committed.
     * We know the transaction is Committed and its execution timestamp, but we do
     * not know its dependencies, and we may still have state leftover from the Accept round
     * that is necessary for recovery.
     *
     * So, for execution of other transactions we may treat a PreCommitted transaction as Committed,
     * using the timestamp to update our dependency set to rule it out as a dependency.
     * But we do not have enough information to execute the transaction, and when recovery calculates
     * {@link BeginRecovery#acceptedStartedBeforeWithoutWitnessing},
     * {@link BeginRecovery#hasCommittedExecutesAfterWithoutWitnessing},
     * and {@link BeginRecovery#committedStartedBeforeAndWitnessed} we may not have the dependencies
     * to calculate the result. For these operations we treat ourselves as whatever Accepted status
     * we may have previously taken, using any proposed dependencies to compute the result.
     *
     * This state exists primarily to permit us to efficiently separate work between different home shards.
     * Take a transaction A that reaches the Committed status and commits to all of its home shard A*'s replicas,
     * but fails to commit to all shards. A takes an execution time later than its TxnId, and in the process
     * adopts a dependency on a transaction B that is coordinated by its home shard B*, that has itself taken
     * a dependency upon A. Importantly, B commits a lower executeAt than A and so will execute first, and once A*
     * commits B, A will remove it from its dependencies. However, there is insufficient information on A*
     * to commit B since it does not know A*'s dependencies, and B* will not process B until A* executes A.
     * To solve this problem we simply permit the executeAt we discover for B to be propagated to A* without
     * its dependencies. Though this does complicate the state machine a little.
